# Facial-Recognition-System
This project predict the live face , What percent live face is similar to training data using OpenCV(ComputerVision) library and Machine Learning algorithm.

To execute this Project You have to follow these steps:
1. first you have to create a dataset. To create a dataset just run the "face_dataset" file. It will create a 100 photos of you which works as dataset.

2.To train the model you have to run the "face_training" file. The path of datasat should same.

3.To test the model you have to run the "face_recognition_testing" file.

Note- Haarcascade files should be in same folder.
